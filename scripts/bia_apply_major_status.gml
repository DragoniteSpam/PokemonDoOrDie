// So you don't have to write the code that checks for Synchronize
// and Magic Bounce and all that other stuff every time you want to
// apply a major status.

// You shouldn't use this to apply "no status," because it'll look for
// text to display on the screen to communicate this, but there won't
// be any text, so the game will crash.

// If you call this from one of the contact ability scripts, or something
// of that nature, remember to reverse the 'user' and 'target' arguments.

// todo each status should have an animation to go with it.

// by the way, 2/3 of this script is choosing the text to display
// based on status. Sorry about that. I had an array of status verbs earlier
// but it was really ugly and I started to get worried that it wouldn't
// work well with translateable text.
// Maybe you could make a script similar to choose_gender but that will
// probably give you the same problem as you had with the array of verbs.
