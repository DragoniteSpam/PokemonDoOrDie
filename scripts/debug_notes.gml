 * Battle keyboard shortcuts:
 *   - When a move is processed (not necessarily when it's selected),
 *      hold a Control key to ensure that its secondary effect(s)
 *      always fire
 *   - When a move is selected in the input menu, releasing the F1
 *      key will set the move's PP to 1, then to 0, then to 1...

/*
 * General keyboard shortcuts:
 *   - Space randomizes the random seed (this should be moved to
 *      another key at some point because space is a really common
 *      key to use for regular gameplay inputs)
