These files are here so that the game launches without crashing
if you don't have access to the actual PBS files. You can also
specify for the game to use them instead of loading the actual
data if you're testing something unrelated to the battle system
and don't want the game to spend ten seconds parsing them every
time you run it (set macro USE_DUMMY_DATA to true).

You don't need to distribute these files with the finished game,
although they're only a couple of kilobytes so it shouldn't
really matter.
