lower priority:
 - shared experience gain

 - game should track what environment battles are initiated in, as determined by
terrain tags: default, grassland, sand, rocky, moving water, still water, tall grass

 - it'd be cool to get reflections working but not an immediate requirement

Notes:

 - in moves with compound effects (Dragon Dance, etc) the
AI weighs certain variables differently than it does in the
default Essentials AI. Situations where this makes a difference
should be really rare, though.

-----------------------------

 - the aki overworld tileset is hard-coded into the draw mesh thing

 - get rid of the xx, yy, zz, in all of the render_* and batch_*
scripts and just have everything get drawn at the thing's xx, yy, zz
because those are the values that they're going to be drawn at anyway
